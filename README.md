# Time-Molecule
A set of ipython notebooks for calculating the quantum Floquet evolution of two (or more) qubit systems, also known as Time Molecules.

These articles provide a complete scientific description of Time Molecule:

https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10609   with dissipation

The dissipative case is described in "Time Molecule with dissipation. Concurrency analysis. For GiTHub."
